// The kubelet binary is responsible for maintaining a set of containers on a particular host VM.

// It then queries Docker to see what is currently running.  It synchronizes the configuration data,
// with the running set of containers by starting or stopping Docker containers.
// kubelet负责在一个特定的host VM上维护一系列的容器
// 它从配置文件以及quorum of etcd servers同步数据，之后请求Docker，查看当前正在运行的容器，它通过启停容器来同步配置数据
// 和一系列正在运行的容器
